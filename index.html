<p class="para1"> most noticeable update on the 2022 MT-15 is the inclusion of a 37mm USD fork, the same unit as on the 2022 Yamaha R15 V4. Gone is the old box-section swingarm, which had received a lot of flak and in comes a cast aluminium swingarm borrowed from the R15. Additionally, the new Yamaha MT-15 also gets a revised digital instrument cluster with Bluetooth connectivity for call, SMS am email alerts. However, navigation has been given a miss. It also gets two new shades called Cyan Storm and Racing Blue, while the previous colours – Ice Fluo-Vermillion and Metallic Black – have been carried forward on the MT-15 Version 2.0</p>
